# VueX2
Vuex is a **state management pattern + library** for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. It also integrates with Vue's official [devtools extension](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) (opens new window)to provide advanced features such as zero-config time-travel debugging and state snapshot export / import.

Vue Router is the official router for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). It deeply integrates with Vue.js core to make building Single Page Applications with Vue.js a breeze. Features include:

+ Nested route/view mapping
+ Modular, component-based router configuration
+ Route params, query, wildcards
+ View transition effects powered by Vue.js' transition system
+ Fine-grained navigation control
+ Links with automatic active CSS classes
+ HTML5 history mode or hash mode, with auto-fallback in IE9
+ Customizable Scroll Behavior
