# Introduction

## What is Artefact-Creator?
Artefact-Creator is a development environment **(IDE)** and a **progressive framework** for building user interfaces and facilitates the development of multi-platform projects by combining the best technologies on the internet. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Artefact is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Artefact is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with [modern tooling]() and [supporting libraries]().

If you’d like to learn more about Artefact before diving in, we [created a video]() walking through the core principles and a sample project.

### Artefact and UI
Artefact is also a complete **UI framework** built on top of [Vue.js]() and [Vuetify](). The goal of the project is to provide developers with the tools they need to build rich and engaging user experiences. Unlike other frameworks, Artefact is designed from the ground up to be easy to learn and rewarding to master with hundreds of carefully crafted components from the [Material Design specification](https://material.io/).

Artefact takes a mobile first approach to design which means your application just works out of the box—whether it’s on a phone, tablet, or desktop computer.

## Why Artefact?
Since its initial release in 2014, [Vue.js]() has grown to be one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks in the world. One of the reasons for this popularity is the wide use of components which enable developers to create concise modules to be used and re-used throughout their application. UI Libraries are collections of these modules that implement a specific style guideline and provide the necessary tools to build expansive web applications.

Artefact is developed exactly according to [Material Design specification]() with every component meticulously crafted to be modular, responsive, and performant. Customize your application with unique and dynamic [Layouts]() and customize the styles of your components using [SASS variables]().

Artefact has a very active development cycle and is patched weekly, responding to community issues and reports at breakneck speed, allowing you to get your hands on bug fixes and enhancements more often. In addition, every major release is accompanied with 18 months of [Long-term support]() for the previous minor version.

Unlike other frameworks, when you develop with Artefact, you are never alone. Stuck on a problem? Take advantage of our massive [community platform]() and collaborate with other Artefact developers in one of our public help channels. Need a more personalized support solution? Artefact offers **elite support** through [GitHub sponsorship]() with options tailored to individuals and businesses. Check out some other ways to [Sponsor Artefact development]().

Below is a list of the top Vue.js frameworks and the features that we feel are important to single developers and businesses when choosing a UI library.
